Here are some results from the 11 responses to our survey comprised of open ended and multiple choice questions:</p>
                <ul class="card-text">
                  <li>The hero (Santa in the snow) was the first thing that most users noticed.</li>
                  <li>Few of the users felt engaged with the cause through information given on site.</li>
                  <li>User's wanted to see upcoming events and how they could participate.</li>
                  <li>User's didn't find the page's design, such as colors and layout, to be appealing.</li>

              <h4 id="scrollspyHeading2">User Persona</h4>
              <p class="card-text mb-auto">In order to further understand our users, we created a user persona, Serena Nelson, who's a kind hearted person. She's at a stage in life where she can help others, but is trying to learn how, even when she may not have the financial means. Here's where we got our information for Serena, and why we created her:</p>
              <ul class="card-text">
                <li>We noticed that all users that took our survey wanted to help, but may not have had the money or known how to help.</li>
                <li>Using this persona we were able to create a design for the website that directly tied into the users purpose for visiting the site, moving other information that may not be as important to this user to landing pages.</li>
                <li>I frequently reflected on our persona, especially the low-fi wireframes (sketches) and when finalizing the hi-fi wireframes and prototype.</li>
              </ul>

          <div class="col p-4 d-flex flex-column position-static">
            <h4 id="scrollspyHeading3">Sketches</h4>
            <p class="card-text mb-auto">Now that we understood our user we could start working on low-fi wireframes (sketches). Our main focus was on how to lay out the information for the user in a way that was clear, as well as giving a feeling of intractability.</p>
            <ul class="card-text">
              <li>The main purpose of these sketches was to explore potential layouts for images and text that assisted the user through their journey.</li>
              <li>We referred back to our survey responses frequently while sketching, keeping in mind frustration points, and features the users want.</li>
              <li>The hero was one of our top priorities and after that was news, featuring recent events, and events featuring upcoming events.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> Please contact me for more info and to see other low-fi sketches.</p>

            <p class="card-text mb-auto">Using Figma I expounded on our low-fi sketches to create mid-fi wireframes, working through each component of the page and different potential variations.</p>
            <p class="card-text mb-auto"> Here were some decisions to be made during this stage:</p>
            <ul class="card-text">
              <li>Hero image</li>
              <li>Color scheme</li>
