  <h2> Problem</h2>
  <p> Many users didn't know how to help or what the Navajo people need. The also din't know how to interact with the site to be able to help if they did become interested.</p>
  <h2> solution</h2>
  <p> We redesigned the hero to be a call to action, and redesigned the home jpage to be focused on guiding the user on their journey through navigation, buttons, and news posts.</p>

    <h2> Surveys</h2>
    <p> After we decided what non-profit organization website we were going to design we decided to conduct a survey in order to determine what was lacking for the user and what we could do better. Here are some results from the 11 responses to our survey comprised of open ended and multiple choice questions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The hero (Santa in the snow) was the first thing that most users noticed.</li>
        <li>Few of the users felt engaged with the cause through information given on site.</li>
        <li>User's wanted to see upcoming events and how they could participate.</li>
        <li>User's didn't find the page's design, such as colors and layout, to be appealing.</li>
    </ul>
